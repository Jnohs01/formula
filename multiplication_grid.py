    **A formula is just a story we tell about a pattern.**  
    Long before calculators, ancient mathematicians literally **measured** triangles and circles to find values like sine and cosine.

    - The Greeks built **chord tables** to measure angles.
    - Indian mathematicians refined these into the **sine** function.
    - Before formulas, there were **tables**.  
      People had to **observe and record** each case â€” just like we're doing here.

    > You're not using magic. You're using **compressed patterns** that smart people noticed and explained.

    This grid below shows how multiplication is just **counting a block of squares**. From this, you can build toward understanding **area**, **algebra**, and even **calculus** â€” one pattern at a time.
